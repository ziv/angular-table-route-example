# Routes as source of truth

Example for Angular 20 application with route as source of truth:

## Why?

Web applications allow us to share a view by URL. If the URL does not contain
the state of the application, it is not possible to share the view. This means
that the URL should contain the state of the application, such as the current
page, filters, and sorting.

## How?

```shell
npm run generate-data
```

```shell
ng serve
```
